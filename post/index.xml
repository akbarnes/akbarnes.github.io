      <description>I deal a lot with large-ish binary file in my work. Typically these are single-file database in the style of Sqlite3. These aren&amp;rsquo;t ideal for putting in Git. Git doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale well to large repository sizes. People always seem to try framing this as not a limitation, but it is. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to using Boar, Restic and finally the Duplicacy deduplicating backup software packages. I think at some point someone had mentioned that it would be awesome to have something like Git but that replaces the packfile format with deduplicating storage.</description>

      <description>First Prototype After seeing ads for the FreeWrite and going so far as to buy an AlphaSmart Neo2, I decided that this a problem spaced under-served by Linux. Sure, there is the E-Ink DIY one driven by a Pi, but it&amp;rsquo;s not really practical: https://hackaday.com/2018/10/20/e-ink-typewriter-is-refreshingly-slow/. This project is about making a Linux software solution based on more conventional hardware and making use of kiosk tools for Linux. This also lets me satisfy other itches, like adding calculator functionality via SageMath or circuit simulator functionality via Falstad.</description>

      <description>I live in the western USA where coyote predation of pets is common. I decided to build a catio for my wandering cat after the following occured:
 I saw coyotes prowling outside the fence three times in the span of a few months My cat snuck out the pet door when we had left on travel one Christmas and went AWOL for two weeks. We found him in the neighors yard having lost about 5 pounds.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve built up a collection of calculators over the last few years after getting a HP 35s for the FE and re-discovering calculators as a distraction free study aid. Nothing wrong with collecting stuff, we all do it at one point in our lives and calculators are compact and relatively cheap. Here&amp;rsquo;s my current stable, roughly in order of aquisition:
 HP 35s TI 36x Pro Casio 991EX ClassWiz (sold) HP Prime HP 12C Platinum 2nd gen HP 10bii+ HP 17bii TI baii plus SwissMicros DM42  HP 35s I bought this for the FE.</description>
