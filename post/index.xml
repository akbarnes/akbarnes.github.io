      <description>I live in the western USA where coyote predation of pets is common. I decided to build a catio for my wandering cat after the following occured:
 I saw coyotes prowling outside the fence three times in the span of a few months My cat snuck out the pet door when we had left on travel one Christmas and went AWOL for two weeks. We found him in the neighors yard having lost about 5 pounds.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve built up a collection of calculators over the last few years after getting a HP 35s for the FE and re-discovering calculators as a distraction free study aid. Nothing wrong with collecting stuff, we all do it at one point in our lives and calculators are compact and relatively cheap. Here&amp;rsquo;s my current stable, roughly in order of aquisition:
 HP 35s TI 36x Pro Casio 991EX ClassWiz (sold) HP Prime HP 12C Platinum 2nd gen HP 10bii+ HP 17bii TI baii plus SwissMicros DM42  HP 35s I bought this for the FE.</description>
