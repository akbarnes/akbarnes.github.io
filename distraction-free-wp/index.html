    <h1 id="first-prototype">First Prototype</h1>
<p>After seeing ads for the FreeWrite and going so far as to buy an
AlphaSmart Neo2, I decided that this a problem spaced under-served by
Linux. Sure, there is the E-Ink DIY one driven by a Pi, but it&rsquo;s not
really practical:
<a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/10/20/e-ink-typewriter-is-refreshingly-slow/">https://hackaday.com/2018/10/20/e-ink-typewriter-is-refreshingly-slow/</a>.
This project is about making a Linux software solution based on more
conventional hardware and making use of kiosk tools for Linux. This
also lets me satisfy other itches, like adding calculator
functionality via SageMath or circuit simulator functionality via
Falstad.</p>
<p>Currently the project is based on an i3 Intel NUC running Xubuntu +
FocusWriter. I have a couple of decisions to make:</p>
<ol>
<li>Should I stick with Intel, go to ARM or stay processor-agnostic?</li>
<li>Should I use native fullscreen applications or web-based ones
running in FIrefox in kiosk mode?</li>
<li>How to Sync? Should I support cloud/network storage, USB drives or
adding hardware to emulate a keyboard like the AlphaSmart?</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently (1) doesn&rsquo;t seem to be too important. There are pros and
cons either way. Staying on Intel means better availability of
pre-prackaged software and the ability to use the majority of
Chromebooks. Going to ARM means the ability to use Pis, Pi0&rsquo;s and
PineBooks, and is probably a better choice for a hacker project. A
cyberdeck version would be pretty sweet.</p>
<p>With (2) the majority of writing applications are written natively so
I haven&rsquo;t found any self-hosted browser-based solutions for writing
other than <a href="https://github.com/writeas/writefreely">https://github.com/writeas/writefreely</a>. However, a Firefox
kiosk-based solution means a couple other benefits: I can limit
internet access by whitelisting sites rather than removing or
disabling networking hardware. This means that I&rsquo;m not limited to
self-hosted solutions and can use ones that are fully or partly
cloud-based like <a href="https://www.calmlywriter.com/">https://www.calmlywriter.com/</a>. This also makes it
easy to add local web-based capabilities like SageMath/Falstad, or
other cloud-based ones like Cocalc/Repl.it/Overleaf. Honestly, having
calculator functionality is more interesting to me than just a writing
tool (I&rsquo;m an engineer and frankly not much of a writer).</p>
<p>With (3) supporting cloud/network storage is easiest from the
user-interface perspective. Using USB drives means the need to give
the user access into the filesystem, complicating UI. And much as I
like my AlphaSmart, emulating a keyboard is a slow unreliable and
pretty rubbish way of transferring data.</p>

<h1 id="notes-software">Notes Software</h1>
<p>After a bit of research, there really isn&rsquo;t much in the way of
distraction-free writing apps that work in a browser. The most popular
(Typora, commercial and FocusWriter, FOSS) are native. Probably this
is an entirely reasonable thing. Currently I&rsquo;m looking at notes apps.
Standard Notes seems nicest, but it&rsquo;s a bit of a pain to get running.
Reasonable alternatives are Trillium, Wiki.js, BookStack, WriteFreely
and the various NextCloud notes add-ons.</p>
<h1 id="tiling-window-managers">Tiling Window Managers</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve flip-flopped again on the software design, and decided to go for
a more hacker-ey approach that uses a tiling window manager + terminal
window instead of a browser in kiosk mode. I&rsquo;m using the following
software:</p>
<pre><code>Xubuntu 18.04
Xmonad window manager
XFCE4 terminal
Vim/Nano text editors
Feh image browser
Zathura PDF viewer
W3M browser
Ranger/NNN file managers
HTOP system viewer
NCDU disk space viewer
</code></pre>
<p>I discovered it&rsquo;s pretty easy to hack together a menu-based interface
with  Fish shell script, though it&rsquo;s a bit janky. Better options are
wiretail (easier, more portable)/dialog (more verbose, more flexible)
which allow for decent-looking GUIs in shell scripts.</p>
<p>Off-topic, I also learned about Zenity which is the GTK equivalent. It
has Python bindings and seems like a nicer alternative to PyQT (pretty
but tedious to code up) and PySimpleGUI (fast to code but hideous as
the library tries to look like a 90s WinForms enterprise app).</p>
<h1 id="console-menu-interface-for-linux-2020-11-12">Console Menu Interface for Linux 2020-11-12</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a menu-based interface for Linux based on the
old DOS shareware program Automenu. My first prototype was hacked
up in Fish Shell here: <a href="https://github.com/akbarnes/pymenu/blob/master/launcher.fish">https://github.com/akbarnes/pymenu/blob/master/launcher.fish</a>
and strayed away a bit from the Automenu style in that it includes
basic support for directory bookmarks and directory navigation. Unlike DOS,
Linux software tends not to have user-friendly file open dialogs
so this seemed like a warranted feature. The downside with Fish
is that it&rsquo;s impossible to create fullscreen menus without additional
software such as whiptail. My next step was a more elegant solution
in Python that was originally based on urwid but later switched to
blessed: <a href="https://github.com/akbarnes/pymenu/blob/master/pymenu.py">https://github.com/akbarnes/pymenu/blob/master/pymenu.py</a>.
I recently discovered <a href="https://github.com/aegirhall/console-menu">https://github.com/aegirhall/console-menu</a>
which appears to be &ldquo;whiptail for python&rdquo; and
<a href="https://github.com/mogproject/easy-menu">https://github.com/mogproject/easy-menu</a> which is the closest
I&rsquo;ve seen to &ldquo;Automenu for Linux.&rdquo;</p>
