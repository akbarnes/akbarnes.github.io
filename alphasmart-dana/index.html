    <p>I have an <a href="/distraction-free-wp/">ongoing project</a> for creating a distraction-free computing environment based on an
intel NUC running Linux. It&rsquo;s a fun project, but better suited for a
workbench than for a study desk where I prefer something with a laptop
form-factor I can move around. I&rsquo;ve taken to using a vintage Alphasmart
Data for studying. I&rsquo;d wanted a Dana back when I was in college but it
was out of my price range then. It&rsquo;s a pretty slick beastie that runs
Palm OS, has dual SD/MMC card slots and can emulate a keyboard to upload
documents - pretty slick for the early 2000s when pretty much everything
needed a custom driver. I picked this guy up on Ebay for $65 and take
notes in markdown which I convert to pdf with PanDoc. The Neos get more
attention as a distraction-free writing tool, but having both I like the
Dana a bit more. Although the resistive digitizer reduces contrast
compared to the Neo, it can display a lot more text, has a backlight, is
more responsive, and can run PalmOS apps. With smartphones a thing,
PalmOS apps aren&rsquo;t super useful anymore, but it&rsquo;s nice to have stuff
like a timer or unit converter handy - stuff that don&rsquo;t involve syncing
with the outside world. I usually use it with my HP Prime G2 graphing
calculator. Thanks to test restrictions, calculators are the last
vestige of offline computing left.</p>
<p><img src="/images/dana_study_setup.jpeg" alt="AlphaSmart Dana on my study desk"></p>
<p>I believe that the Danas were discontinued sometime in the 2000s, while
the Neos lasted until the early 2010s when they were presumably killed
off by netbooks/cheap laptops/tablets/chromebooks. Supposedly when the
Neos were discontinued they ran for only $130 new. It&rsquo;s a shame that
they are gone since there is about nothing left to give an offline
computing (or at least note-taking) experience. There is the FreeWrite
Traveler, which looks pretty sharp and gets a dose of retro-be-gone
compared to the overly hipsterish original FreeWrite, and the embedded
cursor keys seem pretty slick. However, for my use it&rsquo;s still overly
opinionated in that it focuses on being an electronic typewriter - great
for typing out stream-of-consciousness but not great for editing.
Hopefully FreeWrite will eventually produce a Traveler variant with a
more conventional LCD display instead of the slow-updating E-ink.</p>
